            I'm David and my pronouns are he, him. I have spent most of my life
            designing and building custom homes for clients and recently have 
            been studying full stack web development. In the past I did learn a little html,
            Javascript and css with the goal of creating a website for my art 
            business. I am really enjoying learn the various coding languages and
            would very much like to work in web devlopment.
